# App Navigation
- APP CHALLENGES
1. Need to navigate around separate pages in app (React-Router library)
2. Need to allow user to login/logout (make use of google oauth)
3. Need to handle forms in Redux
4. Need to master CRUD ops in React/Redux (Real goal of this application, every app is simplified down to CRUD)
5. Errors will likely occur, need to handle errors

- [x] Install React-Router library
  - Import properties of React-Router(dom) library: BrowserRouter, Route
